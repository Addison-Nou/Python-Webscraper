12/3/2020:
- Cleaned main module of dead code and (most) extraneous comments
- Compartmentalized 'gift' object to new module 'gift.py'
- Gave defaults to existing 'gift' object attributes
- Added new attributes to 'gift' object
- Added methods to 'gift' object:
	- 'print_all_gifts' #Prints all gift attributes for every gift found in a given array of gifts in human readable format
	- 'find_tribe' #Separates and prints list of tribes derived from rank attribute using string split(" / ")
- Fixed formatting on internal 'gift' object string attributes
